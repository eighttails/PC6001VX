INSTALL




For the installation, a simple shell script "install_mplus_fonts"
is now provided. And...

-  "/usr/bin/perl": for the creation of the bold version of
   the Japanese fonts (*1)
-  "gzip": for the compression of the pcf fonts.

are all supposed to exist (and run) to go on with the following steps.

-  the directory "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/mplus" is created
-  if it already existed before the installation began, the old directory
   is renamed into "mplus.BAK"
-  if "mplus.BAK" existed earlier, it will be destroyed
-  the Latin M+ BITMAP FONTS (iso8859-1, iso8859-15) are installed
-  the Japanese M+ BITMAP FONTS are installed
-  the M+ cursors are inatalled (NOT installed with initial settings)
-  fonts.alias is created
-  "mkfontdir" is run
-  "xset fp rehash" is run

As the font path is not set, please edit your "/etc/XF86Config" or use
"xset fp+ /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/mplus" to set the font path.

*1 The program "mkbold (by Mr. Nagao)" used to create bold fonts from normal
   fonts is called from the shell script "install_mplus_fonts".
   If perl is in a different location,
   you will need to modify the first line of "mkbold" script.


If all the environment as described above is correctly set, the installation
should proceed this way.

$ su
# ./install_mplus_fonts

and complete without trouble.




Initial settings configuration ("[ ]" is the default)
Run following commands before "./install_mplus_fonts".

-  Install location [ /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/mplus ]
   If you want to change, "DESTDIR=/some/where/mplus-x.x.x"
   * Then "xset fp rehash" command will not run.

-  Installation of Euro symbol in the latin fonts (iso8859-15) [ YES ]
   If you don't want to install them, "EURO15=NO"

-  Installation of Japanese fonts [ YES ]
   If you don't want to install them, "MPLUSJ=NO"

-  Installation of Japanese bold fonts [ YES ]
   If you don't want to install them, "MKBOLD=NO"

-  Select mplus_j10r-iso font [ W4 ]
   If you want to select 5 dots width "W" and "w" (more natural glyph,
   but will be connected to the next glyph many times), "J10RIS=W5"

   If you want to install M+ BITMAP FONTS in "/some/where/mplus-x.x.x",
   with no Euro symbol, with no Japanese bold fonts,
   the installation should proceed this way.

   $ su
   # DESTDIR=/some/where/mplus-x.x.x EURO15=NO MKBOLD=NO ./install_mplus_fonts

-  Installation of M+ cursors
   If you wish to install them, change the "CURSOR" setting
   in 26rd line to "YES".
   Correct the X11R6's original "cursor.pcf.gz" path with "CURPTH" setting
   in 27th line.




To understand what font exactly are installed, please read the explanations
in the provided file README_E.
