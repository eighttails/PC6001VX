README




M+ BITMAP FONTS were designed to be simple and highly readable.
It incorporates all Kanji (Chinese character in Japanese) until
level 2 (the one described in JISX0208).

With the increasing availability of powerful PCs, scalable fonts and
anti-aliasing, one could question the need of such fonts nowadays,
slow PCs and the increasing popularity of mobile phone with limited resources
etc. are still in need of such font,
and I have there started creating this font foundry at my own pace.




Through the provided shell script "install_mplus_fonts", the following
fonts will be installed.
